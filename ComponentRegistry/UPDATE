UPDATING THE COMPONENT REGISTRY REST SERVICE AND FLEX UI

Procedure for updating
----------------------

- When upgrading to a new version of the ComponentRegistry, check if there are
  updates of the database schema. These will be named upgrade-x.yy.sql, e.g.
  upgrade-1.10.sql

- If the database needs upgrading, first make a backup (dump) of the existing
  database. Stop the application before doing so

- Execute the upgrade script. When upgrading over multiple minor versions, 
  execute the upgrade scripts incrementally

- Then redeploy the WAR and start the application

Version specific issues

  Registry:
