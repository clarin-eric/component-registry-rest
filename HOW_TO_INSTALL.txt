The componentRegistry is setup as a Flex Gui frontend communicating with a java based backend.

Creating war artifact for deployment:

 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn install
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn package
 
 The ComponentRegistry war will include the flex swf file needed to start the application. 
 So deploying the resulting war will be enough to start the application.
 By default the application is set to work when deployed on localhost. If you want to change that 
 change the serverRootUrl property in the pom.xml of ComponentRegistry.




NOTE: on generating java classes from general-component-schema.xsd.
The ComponentRegistry needs the general-component-schema.xsd, which can be found at:
1) http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/general-component-schema.xsd
2) or checkout from svn: svn co http://svn.clarin.eu/metadata/trunk metadata
If you have it, the pom.xml of ComponentRegistry must point to the directory were the schema is located.
Look for maven-jaxb2-plugin configuration and change the location accordingly e.g.:
<schemaDirectory>../../metadata/toolkit/</schemaDirectory>

 
------
Creating initial setup files (eclipse config):
 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn flexmojos:flexbuilder
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn eclipse:eclipse
