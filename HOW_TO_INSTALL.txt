The componentRegistry is setup as a Flex Gui frontend communicating with a java based backend.

Creating initial setup files (eclipse config):

 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn flex:eclipse
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn eclipse:eclipse

Creating war artifact for deployment:

 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn install
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn package
 
 The ComponentRegistry war will include the flex swf file needed to start the application. 
 So deploying the resulting war will be enough to start the application.
