The componentRegistry is setup as a Flex Gui frontend communicating with a java based backend.

Creating war artifact for deployment:

 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn install
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn package
 
 The ComponentRegistry war will include the flex swf file needed to start the application. 
 So deploying the resulting war will be enough to start the application.
 By default the application is set to work when deployed on localhost. If you want to change that 
 change the serverRootUrl property in the pom.xml of ComponentRegistry.


NOTE on generating java classes from general-component-schema.xsd.
The ComponentRegistry needs the general-component-schema.xsd, which can be found at:
1) http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/general-component-schema.xsd
2) or checkout from svn: svn co http://svn.clarin.eu/metadata/trunk metadata
If you have it, the pom.xml of ComponentRegistry must point to the directory were the schema is located.
Look for maven-jaxb2-plugin configuration and change the location accordingly e.g.:
<schemaDirectory>../../metadata/toolkit/</schemaDirectory>

Missing some artifacts for Maven?:
The ComponentBrowserGui project needs some swf files which are not in any maven repository I could find. 
So install them manually: go to ComponentBrowserGui/libs/ and run the commands in maveninstalllib.txt
 
------
Creating initial setup files (eclipse config):
 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn flexmojos:flexbuilder
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn eclipse:eclipse

Flashpolicy (crossdomain.xml).

In order for flash to allow communiction with the server it needs a crossdomain.xml file. 
The componentRegistry uses the as3httpclientlib (http://code.google.com/p/as3httpclientlib/) to
allow http DELETE calls to the server. For this to work it uses communication through sockets
which needs the crossdomain.xml file to be served from a socket. There is a script and deamon 
in the ComponentBrowserGui/flashpolicy dir which can be installed and used to start up such a listener.
