The componentRegistry is setup as a Flex Gui frontend communicating with a java based backend.

Creating war artifact for deployment:

 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn install
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn package
 
 The ComponentRegistry war will include the flex swf file needed to start the application. 
 So deploying the resulting war will be enough to start the application.
 By default the application is set to work when deployed on localhost. If you want to change that 
 change the serverRootUrl property in the pom.xml of ComponentRegistry. There are already build
 profiles for lux16.mpi.nl and catalog.clarin.eu that set these correctly.

 The rest service relies on a Component Registry database, for which a create script can be found in 
 the src/sql directory. For configuration instructions, see the comments in context.xml.


NOTE on generating java classes from general-component-schema.xsd.
The ComponentRegistry needs the general-component-schema.xsd, which should be found at:
1) ComponentRegistry/src/main/binding/ -> that directory has a svn:externals property pointing to the schema.
Do a 'svn propget svn:externals' to see the property. Results in: 'http://svn.clarin.eu/metadata/trunk/toolkit/general-component-schema.xsd general-component-schema.xsd'

Missing some artifacts for Maven?:
The ComponentBrowserGui project needs some swf files which are not in any maven repository I could find. 
So install them manually: go to ComponentBrowserGui/libs/ and run the commands in maveninstalllib.txt
 
------
Creating initial setup files (eclipse config):
 - in ComponentBrowserGui: mvn flexmojos:flexbuilder
 - in ComponentRegistry: mvn eclipse:eclipse
