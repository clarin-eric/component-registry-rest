UPDATING THE COMPONENT REGISTRY REST SERVICE AND FLEX UI

Procedure for updating
----------------------

- When upgrading to a new version of the ComponentRegistry, check if there are
  updates to the schema of the PostgreSQL database. These will be named 
  upgrade-x.yy.sql, e.g. upgrade-1.10.sql for version 1.10.

- If the database needs upgrading, first make a backup (dump) of the existing
  database. Stop the application before doing so

- Execute the upgrade script. When upgrading over multiple minor versions, 
  execute the upgrade scripts incrementally

- Make sure to grant all required rights (GRANT ALL unless specified
  otherwise) to the component registry database user (usually compreg) on
  any newly added tables, views, and sequences.

- Then redeploy the WAR and start the application
